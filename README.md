# snowflake-ui-solarized-dark-theme
Solarized Dark theme for the Snowflake UI (to be used with a CSS override add-on like Stylebot).

The Snowflake UI is based on the open source [Code Mirror editor](https://codemirror.net/). While Code Mirror has theme support, the themes does not work as-is in Snowflake. So I made a quick adaptation of the Solarized Dark theme for it to work using Stylebot.
